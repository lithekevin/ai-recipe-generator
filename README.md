# AI Recipe Generator

AI Recipe Generator is a serverless web application that lets users generate creative recipe ideas from a list of ingredients. It leverages AWS Amplify to manage frontend hosting, backend APIs, authentication, and continuous deployment. The backend integrates with Amazon Bedrock using the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model to process ingredient inputs and generate recipe suggestions.
